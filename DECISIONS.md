# Decision log

Every judgement call made unattended in this repository, with the options it was given and the
commit to roll back to. Written by the `factory` agent (`.opencode/skills/factory/SKILL.md`).

Rolling one back:

```bash
git log --grep 'Decision: D-0011' --format='%H %s'   # the effect commit
git revert <that sha>                                 # a forward fix; no history rewrite
```

`Checkpoint:` is the commit taken *before* the decision, never after, and that order is
load-bearing: a checkpoint taken afterwards records the state the decision produced, which is the
thing you already have.

**This log starts at D-0011 on purpose.** Ids are shared across the repository rather than per
branch, because `git log --grep 'Decision: D-0011'` has to name exactly one commit and
`scripts/check-decisions.py` refuses a reused id. D-0001–D-0010 belong to the branch that installs
the decision-log gate and the `make verify` hook for it (`feat/factory-harness`, PR #217), which
was still open when the first entry below was written. When the two files meet, both halves are
kept; nothing here renumbers anything.

## D-0011 · One typeface and one width model for the controls you type into

- Question: #202 measured every form control on `/settings` in Arial 13.33 px beside 16 px
  system-ui buttons, at three field widths on one page (65 px, 163 px, 185 px), with one selector
  -- the file's only input rule, `input[type="text"]` -- behind all of it. What is the shared model
  that replaces it?
- Options: `font: inherit` on `input`/`select`/`textarea` plus the existing `width: 100%;
  max-width: 22ch` model extended to every type a template types into, with `select` and the
  toggles excluded | one rule for every input, radios, checkboxes and selects included | `width:
  100%` with no `max-width`, so every field fills its column | keep `22ch` on `text` and add one
  rule per page for each of the other four types
- Chose: `font: inherit` on `input`/`select`/`textarea` plus the existing `width: 100%; max-width:
  22ch` model extended to every type a template types into, with `select` and the toggles excluded
- Why: the fourth option is the shape that caused the defect -- a list of types somebody has to
  remember -- so it loses on touch. The second loses on measurement: `width: 100%` on a radio is a
  312 px tick box at the artifact viewport, and a `select` capped at 22ch truncates a profile
  called "Long weekend during the school holidays", which is the exact failure the phone block in
  this stylesheet exists to prevent. The third loses on the reason the rule was written at all:
  the override-reason box lives in a table cell, a cell cannot shrink below the preferred width of
  its controls, and dropping the cap hands the page's width back to whichever control is widest.
  The first also takes the tie-break that follows the surrounding code: `text` already had this
  model, and `table.rows form select { max-width: 100% }` is already this file's way of clamping a
  select to the page rather than capping it. Two things the entry has to say out loud: the typeface
  and the width ship together because `ch` resolves against the element's own font, so
  `max-width: 22ch` is 163 px in Arial and 196 px in the page's 16 px -- the font alone moves every
  field without an edit to the rule that sizes it; and the type list is the positive one (the types
  you type into), so a type added to a template and missing from the list fails the capture loudly
  instead of silently inheriting `width: 100%` the way a complement list would.

  typed-control width model, replacing `input[type="text"]`), DECISIONS.md

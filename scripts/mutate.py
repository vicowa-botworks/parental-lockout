"""Mutation battery: revert one safety property at a time and insist the suite notices.

A green suite says the code passes the tests. It does not say the tests would fail
if the code were wrong, and for this product that difference is the whole point -- a
lockout that silently stops locking out is exactly the failure a test can bless. So
each entry in scripts/mutations/*.json puts one known bug back into the source and
the run checks that something goes red.

Usage:

    scripts/mutate.py                      # every set under scripts/mutations/
    scripts/mutate.py scripts/mutations/schedule.json
    scripts/mutate.py --only S1,W3         # a subset, for working on one finding
    scripts/mutate.py --self-test           # the verdict rules only: no Go, no battery

Five ways a battery like this can report success while testing nothing, all five
handled here:

  - a mutation whose pattern is not in the file tests nothing and looks like a pass,
    so the pattern's occurrence count is checked against the entry before anything
    runs, and a mismatch is INVALID;
  - a mutation that breaks the BUILD makes every later mutant "fail", so the run
    reports everything caught while proving nothing -- a build failure is therefore
    INVALID, never CAUGHT;
  - a baseline that is already red makes every mutant look caught for the wrong
    reason, so the run refuses to start unless the unmutated tree is green;
  - a pattern that matches somewhere other than where it was meant to land mutates
    the wrong line and can pass for the wrong reason, so every entry states how many
    occurrences it expects and the run checks the count;
  - a package that STOPS RUNNING on the test timeout exits non-zero like any caught
    mutant, so it reads as a guard holding when nothing asserted anything -- a stall
    with no failing test is therefore INVALID too, and a stall after real failures
    says so on its line (see verdict).

The source is restored between every mutant, from the copy taken at startup. That is
not tidiness: restoring only the file just mutated lets mutant N run on top of
mutant N-1, and then neither the catches nor the survivors mean anything.

The run happens in a throwaway copy of the repository, never in the working tree.
Two reasons, both learned the hard way. An interrupted run used to leave the tree
mutated. The second is subtler: the runner snapshots only the files it mutates, so
everything else in the package -- the tests, above all -- stays live. Edit a test
file while a battery is running and every mutant after that moment fails to compile
and is reported INVALID, which reads like a broken mutant set and is really a broken
workflow. One run reported 53 INVALID out of 55 that way. Copy the tree and there is
nothing to interfere with, and nothing to dirty.

An entry may be marked "equivalent" when the mutation cannot be distinguished from
correct behaviour by any input -- a probe wider than the proof needs, say. Those are
reported separately and never counted as a pass, and each carries a note saying why.
A survivor that is not marked is a real gap in the suite: the fix is a better test,
not a new note.

Exit status is 0 only when nothing survived and nothing failed to apply.
